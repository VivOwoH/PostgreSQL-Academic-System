# Aryan's Notes
- Create a selection menu rather than enabling input text - this is more secure and ensures data conforms to requirements
- Nav bar children css (currently invisible until hover)
- Search page should be drop-down menu
- Css for adding new lecture (have the two tables side by side + drop down menus should be stacked vertically)
- Report
- Upload individual progress (SQL queries)
- Traverse admin sql access
